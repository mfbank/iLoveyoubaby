## Image Recommendations:
- Use JPG format for photos (smaller file size)
- Use GIF format for animations
- Recommended photo dimensions: 400x300px or similar aspect ratio
- Keep file sizes reasonable for web loading

## How to Add Your Images:
1. Save your photos with the exact filenames listed above
2. Place them in this `images/` folder
3. The website will automatically display them

## Placeholder Images:
Until you add your own images, the website will show broken image placeholders. This is normal and expected - just replace them with your actual photos!

## Customizing:
- You can easily change the captions by editing the text in `main.html`
- The password can be changed in `script.js` (look for 'yourpassword')
- All styling can be customized in `style.css`
